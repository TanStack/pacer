# Function: createAsyncRateLimiter()

```ts
function createAsyncRateLimiter<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): SolidAsyncRateLimiter<TFn>
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts:73](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts#L73)

A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncRateLimiter` instance to limit how many times an async function can execute within a time window.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Rate limiting allows an async function to execute up to a specified limit within a time window,
then blocks subsequent calls until the window passes. This is useful for respecting API rate limits,
managing resource constraints, or controlling bursts of async operations.

Unlike the non-async RateLimiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* `AnyAsyncFunction`

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`AsyncRateLimiterOptions`\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

[`SolidAsyncRateLimiter`](../interfaces/solidasyncratelimiter.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call rate limiting with return value
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data; // Return value is preserved
  },
  { limit: 5, window: 1000 } // 5 calls per second
);

// With state management and return value
const [data, setData] = createSignal(null);
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    setData(result);
    return result; // Return value can be used by the caller
  },
  {
    limit: 10,
    window: 60000, // 10 calls per minute
    onReject: (info) => console.log(`Rate limit exceeded: ${info.nextValidTime - Date.now()}ms until next window`)
  }
);
```
