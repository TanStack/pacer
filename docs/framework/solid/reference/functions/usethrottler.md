# Function: useThrottler()

```ts
function useThrottler<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): Accessor<{
  cancel: () => void;
  getExecutionCount: () => number;
  maybeExecute: (...args) => void;
}>
```

Defined in: [packages/solid-pacer/src/throttler/useThrottler.ts:45](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/throttler/useThrottler.ts#L45)

A low-level React hook that creates a `Throttler` instance that limits how often the provided function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc). For a simpler and higher-level hook that
integrates directly with React's createSignal, see useThrottledState.

Throttling ensures a function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting
expensive operations or UI updates.

The hook returns an object containing:
- maybeExecute: The throttled function that respects the configured wait time
- cancel: A function to cancel any pending trailing execution
- getExecutionCount: A function that returns the number of times the throttled function has executed

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

• **TArgs** *extends* `any`[]

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`ThrottlerOptions`

## Returns

`Accessor`\<\{
  `cancel`: () => `void`;
  `getExecutionCount`: () => `number`;
  `maybeExecute`: (...`args`) => `void`;
 \}\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic throttling with custom state
const [value, setValue] = createSignal(0);
const { maybeExecute } = useThrottler(setValue, { wait: 1000 });

// With Redux
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const { maybeExecute } = useThrottler(
  (value) => dispatch(updateAction(value)),
  { wait: 1000 }
);

// With any state manager
const { maybeExecute, cancel } = useThrottler(
  (value) => stateManager.setState(value),
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
  }
);
```
