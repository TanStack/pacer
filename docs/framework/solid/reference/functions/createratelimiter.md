# Function: createRateLimiter()

```ts
function createRateLimiter<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): SolidRateLimiter<TFn>
```

Defined in: [rate-limiter/createRateLimiter.ts:68](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/rate-limiter/createRateLimiter.ts#L68)

A low-level Solid hook that creates a `RateLimiter` instance to enforce rate limits on function execution.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Rate limiting is a simple "hard limit" approach that allows executions until a maximum count is reached within
a time window, then blocks all subsequent calls until the window resets. Unlike throttling or debouncing,
it does not attempt to space out or collapse executions intelligently.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

For smoother execution patterns:
- Use throttling when you want consistent spacing between executions (e.g. UI updates)
- Use debouncing when you want to collapse rapid-fire events (e.g. search input)
- Use rate limiting only when you need to enforce hard limits (e.g. API rate limits)

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`RateLimiterOptions`\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

[`SolidRateLimiter`](../interfaces/solidratelimiter.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic rate limiting - max 5 calls per minute with a sliding window
const rateLimiter = createRateLimiter(apiCall, {
  limit: 5,
  window: 60000,
  windowType: 'sliding'
});

// Monitor rate limit status
const handleClick = () => {
  if (rateLimiter.remainingInWindow() > 0) {
    rateLimiter.maybeExecute(data);
  } else {
    showRateLimitWarning();
  }
};

// Access rate limiter state via signals
console.log('Executions:', rateLimiter.executionCount());
console.log('Rejections:', rateLimiter.rejectionCount());
console.log('Remaining:', rateLimiter.remainingInWindow());
console.log('Next window in:', rateLimiter.msUntilNextWindow());
```
