# Function: useRateLimiter()

```ts
function useRateLimiter<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): Accessor<{
  getExecutionCount: () => number;
  getRejectionCount: () => number;
  getRemainingInWindow: () => number;
  maybeExecute: (...args) => boolean;
  reset: () => void;
}>
```

Defined in: [packages/solid-pacer/src/rate-limiter/useRateLimiter.ts:53](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/rate-limiter/useRateLimiter.ts#L53)

A low-level React hook that creates a `RateLimiter` instance to enforce rate limits on function execution.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Rate limiting is a simple "hard limit" approach that allows executions until a maximum count is reached within
a time window, then blocks all subsequent calls until the window resets. Unlike throttling or debouncing,
it does not attempt to space out or collapse executions intelligently.

For smoother execution patterns:
- Use throttling when you want consistent spacing between executions (e.g. UI updates)
- Use debouncing when you want to collapse rapid-fire events (e.g. search input)
- Use rate limiting only when you need to enforce hard limits (e.g. API rate limits)

The hook returns an object containing:
- maybeExecute: The rate-limited function that respects the configured limits
- getExecutionCount: Returns the number of successful executions
- getRejectionCount: Returns the number of rejected executions due to rate limiting
- getRemainingInWindow: Returns how many more executions are allowed in the current window
- reset: Resets the execution counts and window timing

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

• **TArgs** *extends* `any`[]

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`RateLimiterOptions`

## Returns

`Accessor`\<\{
  `getExecutionCount`: () => `number`;
  `getRejectionCount`: () => `number`;
  `getRemainingInWindow`: () => `number`;
  `maybeExecute`: (...`args`) => `boolean`;
  `reset`: () => `void`;
 \}\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic rate limiting - max 5 calls per minute
const { maybeExecute } = useRateLimiter(apiCall, {
  maxExecutions: 5,
  windowMs: 60000
});

// With Redux
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const { maybeExecute, getRemainingInWindow } = useRateLimiter(
  (value) => dispatch(updateAction(value)),
  { maxExecutions: 10, windowMs: 30000 }
);

// Monitor rate limit status
const handleClick = () => {
  const remaining = getRemainingInWindow();
  if (remaining > 0) {
    maybeExecute(data);
  } else {
    showRateLimitWarning();
  }
};
```
