# Function: createAsyncDebouncer()

```ts
function createAsyncDebouncer<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): Accessor<{
  cancel: () => void;
  getExecutionCount: () => number;
  maybeExecute: (...args) => Promise<void>;
}>
```

Defined in: [packages/solid-pacer/src/async-debouncer/createAsyncDebouncer.ts:40](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-debouncer/createAsyncDebouncer.ts#L40)

A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncDebouncer` instance to delay execution of an async function.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a debouncer instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Async debouncing ensures that an async function only executes after a specified delay has passed since its last invocation.
This is useful for handling fast-changing inputs like search fields, form validation, or any scenario where you want to
wait for user input to settle before making expensive async calls.

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

• **TArgs** *extends* `any`[]

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`AsyncDebouncerOptions`

## Returns

`Accessor`\<\{
  `cancel`: () => `void`;
  `getExecutionCount`: () => `number`;
  `maybeExecute`: (...`args`) => `Promise`\<`void`\>;
 \}\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call debouncing
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncDebouncer(
  async (query: string) => {
    const results = await api.search(query);
    return results;
  },
  { wait: 500 }
);

// With state management
const [results, setResults] = createSignal([]);
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncDebouncer(
  async (searchTerm) => {
    const data = await searchAPI(searchTerm);
    setResults(data);
  },
  {
    wait: 300,
  }
);
```
