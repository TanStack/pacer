# Function: createAsyncDebouncer()

```ts
function createAsyncDebouncer<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): SolidAsyncDebouncer<TFn>
```

Defined in: [async-debouncer/createAsyncDebouncer.ts:77](https://github.com/tanstack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-debouncer/createAsyncDebouncer.ts#L77)

A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncDebouncer` instance to delay execution of an async function.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a debouncer instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Async debouncing ensures that an async function only executes after a specified delay has passed since its last invocation.
Each new invocation resets the delay timer. This is useful for handling frequent events like window resizing
or input changes where you only want to execute the handler after the events have stopped occurring.

Unlike throttling which allows execution at regular intervals, debouncing prevents any execution until
the function stops being called for the specified delay period.

Unlike the non-async Debouncer, this async version supports returning values from the debounced function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the debounced function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and debouncer instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncDebouncer instance

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* `AnyAsyncFunction`

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`AsyncDebouncerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

[`SolidAsyncDebouncer`](../../interfaces/solidasyncdebouncer.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call debouncing
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncDebouncer(
  async (query: string) => {
    const results = await api.search(query);
    return results;
  },
  { wait: 500 }
);

// With state management
const [results, setResults] = createSignal([]);
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncDebouncer(
  async (searchTerm) => {
    const data = await searchAPI(searchTerm);
    setResults(data);
  },
  {
    wait: 300,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false, // Skip trailing edge updates
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('API call failed:', error);
    }
  }
);
```
