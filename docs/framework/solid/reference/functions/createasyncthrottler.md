# Function: createAsyncThrottler()

```ts
function createAsyncThrottler<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   initialOptions, 
selector?): SolidAsyncThrottler<TFn, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [async-throttler/createAsyncThrottler.ts:72](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-throttler/createAsyncThrottler.ts#L72)

A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncThrottler` instance to limit how often an async function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Async throttling ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting expensive API calls,
database operations, or other async tasks.

Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyAsyncFunction`

• **TSelected** = `AsyncThrottlerState`\<`TFn`\>

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`AsyncThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector?

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

[`SolidAsyncThrottler`](../../interfaces/solidasyncthrottler.md)\<`TFn`, `TSelected`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call throttling
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { wait: 1000 }
);

// With state management
const [data, setData] = createSignal(null);
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncThrottler(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    setData(result);
  },
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false, // Skip trailing edge updates
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('API call failed:', error);
    }
  }
);
```
