# Function: useAsyncDebouncer()

```ts
function useAsyncDebouncer<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): AsyncDebouncer<TFn, TArgs>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts:40](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts#L40)

A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncDebouncer` instance to delay execution of an async function.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a debouncer instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Async debouncing ensures that an async function only executes after a specified delay has passed since its last invocation.
This is useful for handling fast-changing inputs like search fields, form validation, or any scenario where you want to
wait for user input to settle before making expensive async calls.

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

• **TArgs** *extends* `any`[]

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`AsyncDebouncerOptions`

## Returns

`AsyncDebouncer`\<`TFn`, `TArgs`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call debouncing
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncDebouncer(
  async (query: string) => {
    const results = await api.search(query);
    return results;
  },
  { wait: 500 }
);

// With state management
const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncDebouncer(
  async (searchTerm) => {
    const data = await searchAPI(searchTerm);
    setResults(data);
  },
  {
    wait: 300,
  }
);
```
