# Function: useDebouncer()

```ts
function useDebouncer<TFn>(fn, options): Debouncer<TFn>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncer.ts:42](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncer.ts#L42)

A React hook that creates and manages a Debouncer instance.

This is a lower-level hook that provides direct access to the Debouncer's functionality without
any built-in state management. This allows you to integrate it with any state management solution
you prefer (useState, Redux, Zustand, etc.).

This hook provides debouncing functionality to limit how often a function can be called,
waiting for a specified delay before executing the latest call. This is useful for handling
frequent events like window resizing, scroll events, or real-time search inputs.

The debouncer will only execute the function after the specified wait time has elapsed
since the last call. If the function is called again before the wait time expires, the
timer resets and starts waiting again.

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`DebouncerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

`Debouncer`\<`TFn`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Debounce a search function to limit API calls
const searchDebouncer = useDebouncer(
  (query: string) => fetchSearchResults(query),
  { wait: 500 } // Wait 500ms after last keystroke
);

// In an event handler
const handleChange = (e) => {
  searchDebouncer.maybeExecute(e.target.value);
};

// Get number of times the debounced function has executed
const executionCount = searchDebouncer.getExecutionCount();

// Get the pending state
const isPending = searchDebouncer.getIsPending();
```
