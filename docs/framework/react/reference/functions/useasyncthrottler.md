# Function: useAsyncThrottler()

```ts
function useAsyncThrottler<TFn>(fn, options): AsyncThrottler<TFn>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottler.ts:55](https://github.com/tanstack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottler.ts#L55)

A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncThrottler` instance to limit how often an async function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Async throttling ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting expensive API calls,
database operations, or other async tasks.

Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* `AnyAsyncFunction`

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`AsyncThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

`AsyncThrottler`\<`TFn`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call throttling with return value
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data; // Return value is preserved
  },
  { wait: 1000 }
);

// With state management and return value
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    setData(result);
    return result; // Return value can be used by the caller
  },
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
  }
);
```
