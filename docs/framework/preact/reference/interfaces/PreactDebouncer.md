Defined in: preact-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncer.ts:21

Reactive state that will be updated and re-rendered when the debouncer state changes

***

### ~~store~~

```ts
readonly store: Store<Readonly<DebouncerState<TFn>>>;
```

Defined in: preact-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncer.ts:27

#### Deprecated

Use `debouncer.state` instead of `debouncer.store.state` if you want to read reactive state.
The state on the store object is not reactive, as it has not been wrapped in a `useStore` hook internally.
Although, you can make the state reactive by using the `useStore` in your own usage.
