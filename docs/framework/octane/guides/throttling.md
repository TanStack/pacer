Throttling limits how often a function can execute while calls continue to arrive. Unlike debouncing, throttling does not wait for activity to stop. It creates a bounded execution interval that works well for continuous events and updates.

With the default settings, the first call executes immediately. Calls received during the wait period are consolidated into one trailing execution that uses the latest arguments.

## How throttling works

The timeline below shows a throttler that allows one execution every three ticks:

```text
Throttling (one execution per 3 ticks)
Timeline: [1 second per tick]
Calls:        ⬇️  ⬇️  ⬇️           ⬇️  ⬇️  ⬇️  ⬇️             ⬇️
Executed:     ✅  ❌  ⏳  ->   ✅  ❌  ❌  ❌  ✅             ✅
             [================================================================]
             ^ At most one execution per interval

             [First burst]    [More calls]              [Spaced calls]
             Execute first    Keep latest trailing      Execute when allowed
```

Calls may be discarded, but execution continues at a predictable interval while activity is ongoing.

## When to use throttling

Choose throttling when:

- Work should continue while events are arriving.
- Executions should be spaced by a minimum interval.
- Intermediate calls may be discarded.
- Immediate feedback from the first call is useful.

Choose another utility when:

- Work should wait until activity stops. Use [debouncing](./debouncing.md).
- A specific number of calls may run within a window. Use [rate limiting](./rate-limiting.md).
- Every operation must eventually run. Use [queuing](./queuing.md).
- Several items should run together. Use [batching](./batching.md).
- You need Promise results, retries, or abort support. Use [async throttling](./async-throttling.md).

## Choose an API

- `useThrottledCallback` for a stable throttled event handler
- `useThrottledState` or `useThrottledValue` for throttled Octane state
- `useThrottler` for lifecycle methods and selected state

Use the callback API for event handlers, the state or value API for rate-controlled UI state, and the instance API for lifecycle methods and timing state.

## Use useThrottler

Call hooks at the top level of a compiled Octane component. The compiler assigns each call its own hook slot. The hook retains its utility across renders and commits the current callback and options in a layout effect. Selected state triggers rendering, and unmounting cleans up the utility. Use Octane 0.1.36; this package does not support the 0.2 line yet.

```tsx
import { createRoot, useState } from 'octane';
import { useThrottler } from '@tanstack/octane-pacer';
function Example() @{
  const [input, setInput] = useState('hello');
  const [wait, setWait] = useState(200);
  const [history, setHistory] = useState<Array<string>>([]);
  const utility = useThrottler((value: string) => { setHistory((previous) => [...previous, value]); }, { wait: wait, leading: false }, (state) => state);
  <main>
<h1>Octane useThrottler</h1><p>Limit executions to one per interval while retaining the latest trailing call.</p>

<section><h2>Utility state</h2><pre>{JSON.stringify(utility.state, null, 2)}</pre></section>
<p class="caption">The hook retains one utility across renders and commits current options and callbacks.</p>
</main>
}
createRoot(document.getElementById('app')!).render(Example);
```

## Options and controls

`maybeExecute` limits executions to one per `wait` interval. `leading` controls the first execution and `trailing` retains the most recent deferred call. Use `flush()` to execute pending work and `cancel()` to discard its timer. Select `isPending`, `lastArgs`, and `executionCount` to render progress.
## Reactive options and cleanup

Use an options factory or property getters to read reactive settings. Updating options preserves the utility and its pending work. An already scheduled timer keeps its current deadline unless you explicitly cancel or reschedule it.

The owning component supplies default cleanup. `onUnmount` replaces that behavior and receives the same adapter instance. To flush pending work, provide a callback that calls `flush()` where supported. For async work, also decide whether it should be aborted.

## State and convenience helpers

Pass a selector as the final argument to choose state fields. Without a selector, selected state is `{}`. Core methods and the raw store remain available regardless of your selection.

`useThrottledCallback` returns only the scheduled callback. Use it for event handlers that do not need access to state or control methods.

`useThrottledState` owns a delayed value. `useThrottledValue` derives one from an existing reactive input. See the [adapter guide](../adapter.md) for each helper's return shape.
