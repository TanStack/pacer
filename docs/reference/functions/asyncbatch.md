# Function: asyncBatch()

```ts
function asyncBatch<TValue>(fn, options): (item) => void
```

Defined in: [async-batcher.ts:446](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-batcher.ts#L446)

Creates an async batcher that processes items in batches

Unlike the sync batcher, this async version:
- Handles promises and returns results from batch executions
- Provides error handling with configurable error behavior
- Tracks success, error, and settle counts separately
- Has state tracking for when batches are executing

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error, the batch of items that failed, and batcher instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncBatcher instance

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the async batcher
- Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful batch execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onError` callback to react to batch execution errors and implement custom error handling
- Use `onSettled` callback to react to batch execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
- Use `onExecute` callback to react to batch execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onItemsChange` callback to react to items being added or removed from the batcher
- The state includes total items processed, success/error counts, and execution status
- State can be accessed via the underlying AsyncBatcher instance's `store.state` property
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TValue**

## Parameters

### fn

(`items`) => `Promise`\<`any`\>

### options

[`AsyncBatcherOptions`](../../interfaces/asyncbatcheroptions.md)\<`TValue`\>

## Returns

`Function`

Adds an item to the async batcher
If the batch size is reached, timeout occurs, or shouldProcess returns true, the batch will be processed

### Parameters

#### item

`TValue`

### Returns

`void`

## Example

```ts
const batchItems = asyncBatch<number>(
  async (items) => {
    const result = await processApiCall(items);
    console.log('Processing:', items);
    return result;
  },
  {
    maxSize: 3,
    wait: 1000,
    onSuccess: (result) => console.log('Batch succeeded:', result),
    onError: (error) => console.error('Batch failed:', error)
  }
);

batchItems(1);
batchItems(2);
batchItems(3); // Triggers batch processing
```
