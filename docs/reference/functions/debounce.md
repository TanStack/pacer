# Function: debounce()

```ts
function debounce<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): (...args) => void
```

Defined in: [debouncer.ts:287](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/debouncer.ts#L287)

Creates a debounced function that delays invoking the provided function until after a specified wait time.
Multiple calls during the wait period will cancel previous pending invocations and reset the timer.

This the the simple function wrapper implementation pulled from the Debouncer class. If you need
more control over the debouncing behavior, use the Debouncer class directly.

If leading option is true, the function will execute immediately on the first call, then wait the delay
before allowing another execution.

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the debouncer
- Use `onExecute` callback to react to function execution and implement custom logic
- The state includes canLeadingExecute, execution count, and isPending status
- State can be accessed via the underlying Debouncer instance's `store.state` property
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property
