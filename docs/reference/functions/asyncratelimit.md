# Function: asyncRateLimit()

```ts
function asyncRateLimit<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): (...args) => Promise<undefined | ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter.ts:507](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-rate-limiter.ts#L507)

Creates an async rate-limited function that will execute the provided function up to a maximum number of times within a time window.

Unlike the non-async rate limiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

Note that rate limiting is a simpler form of execution control compared to throttling or debouncing:
- A rate limiter will allow all executions until the limit is reached, then block all subsequent calls until the window resets
- A throttler ensures even spacing between executions, which can be better for consistent performance
- A debouncer collapses multiple calls into one, which is better for handling bursts of events

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the rate limiter
- `initialState` can be a partial state object
- Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful function execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onError` callback to react to function execution errors and implement custom error handling
- Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
- Use `onReject` callback to react to executions being rejected when rate limit is exceeded
- The state includes execution times, success/error counts, and current execution status
- State can be accessed via the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance's `store.state` property
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property

Consider using throttle() or debounce() if you need more intelligent execution control. Use rate limiting when you specifically
need to enforce a hard limit on the number of executions within a time period.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and rate limiter instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance
- Rate limit rejections (when limit is exceeded) are handled separately from execution errors via the `onReject` handler

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* [`AnyAsyncFunction`](../../type-aliases/anyasyncfunction.md)

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

[`AsyncRateLimiterOptions`](../../interfaces/asyncratelimiteroptions.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

`Function`

Attempts to execute the rate-limited function if within the configured limits.
Will reject execution if the number of calls in the current window exceeds the limit.

Error Handling:
- If the rate-limited function throws and no `onError` handler is configured,
  the error will be thrown from this method.
- If an `onError` handler is configured, errors will be caught and passed to the handler,
  and this method will return undefined.
- The error state can be checked using `getErrorCount()` and `getIsExecuting()`.

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

A promise that resolves with the function's return value, or undefined if an error occurred and was handled by onError

### Throws

The error from the rate-limited function if no onError handler is configured

### Example

```ts
const rateLimiter = new AsyncRateLimiter(fn, { limit: 5, window: 1000 });

// First 5 calls will return a promise that resolves with the result
const result = await rateLimiter.maybeExecute('arg1', 'arg2');

// Additional calls within the window will return undefined
const result2 = await rateLimiter.maybeExecute('arg1', 'arg2'); // undefined
```

## Example

```ts
// Rate limit to 5 calls per minute with a sliding window
const rateLimited = asyncRateLimit(makeApiCall, {
  limit: 5,
  window: 60000,
  windowType: 'sliding',
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
  },
  onReject: (rateLimiter) => {
    console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${rateLimiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
  }
});

// First 5 calls will execute immediately
// Additional calls will be rejected until the minute window resets
// Returns the API response directly
const result = await rateLimited();

// For more even execution, consider using throttle instead:
const throttled = throttle(makeApiCall, { wait: 12000 }); // One call every 12 seconds
```
