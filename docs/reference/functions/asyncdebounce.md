# Function: asyncDebounce()

```ts
function asyncDebounce<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): (...args) => Promise<undefined | ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [async-debouncer.ts:440](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-debouncer.ts#L440)

Creates an async debounced function that delays execution until after a specified wait time.
The debounced function will only execute once the wait period has elapsed without any new calls.
If called again during the wait period, the timer resets and a new wait period begins.

Unlike the non-async Debouncer, this async version supports returning values from the debounced function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the debounced function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and debouncer instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncDebouncer instance
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the async debouncer
- Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful function execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onError` callback to react to function execution errors and implement custom error handling
- Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
- The state includes canLeadingExecute, error count, execution status, and success/settle counts
- State can be accessed via `asyncDebouncer.store.state` when using the class directly
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `asyncDebouncer.state`

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* [`AnyAsyncFunction`](../../type-aliases/anyasyncfunction.md)

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

[`AsyncDebouncerOptions`](../../interfaces/asyncdebounceroptions.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

`Function`

Attempts to execute the debounced function.
If a call is already in progress, it will be queued.

Error Handling:
- If the debounced function throws and no `onError` handler is configured,
  the error will be thrown from this method.
- If an `onError` handler is configured, errors will be caught and passed to the handler,
  and this method will return undefined.
- The error state can be checked using `getErrorCount()` and `getIsExecuting()`.

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

A promise that resolves with the function's return value, or undefined if an error occurred and was handled by onError

### Throws

The error from the debounced function if no onError handler is configured

## Example

```ts
const debounced = asyncDebounce(async (value: string) => {
  const result = await saveToAPI(value);
  return result; // Return value is preserved
}, {
  wait: 1000,
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
  },
  throwOnError: true // Will both log the error and throw it
});

// Will only execute once, 1 second after the last call
// Returns the API response directly
const result = await debounced("third");
```
