# Function: asyncDebounce()

```ts
function asyncDebounce<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): (...args) => Promise<undefined | ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [async-debouncer.ts:268](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-debouncer.ts#L268)

Creates an async debounced function that delays execution until after a specified wait time.
The debounced function will only execute once the wait period has elapsed without any new calls.
If called again during the wait period, the timer resets and a new wait period begins.

Unlike the non-async Debouncer, this async version supports returning values from the debounced function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the debounced function.

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* [`AnyAsyncFunction`](../type-aliases/anyasyncfunction.md)

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`Omit`\<[`AsyncDebouncerOptions`](../interfaces/asyncdebounceroptions.md)\<`TFn`\>, `"enabled"`\>

## Returns

`Function`

Attempts to execute the debounced function
If a call is already in progress, it will be queued

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

## Example

```ts
const debounced = asyncDebounce(async (value: string) => {
  const result = await saveToAPI(value);
  return result; // Return value is preserved
}, { wait: 1000 });

// Will only execute once, 1 second after the last call
// Returns the API response directly
const result = await debounced("third");
```
