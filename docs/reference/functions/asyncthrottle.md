# Function: asyncThrottle()

```ts
function asyncThrottle<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): (...args) => Promise<undefined | ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [async-throttler.ts:475](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-throttler.ts#L475)

Creates an async throttled function that limits how often the function can execute.
The throttled function will execute at most once per wait period, even if called multiple times.
If called while executing, it will wait until execution completes before scheduling the next call.

Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the async throttler
- Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful function execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onError` callback to react to function execution errors and implement custom error handling
- Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
- The state includes error count, execution status, last execution time, and success/settle counts
- State can be accessed via the underlying AsyncThrottler instance's `store.state` property
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* [`AnyAsyncFunction`](../../type-aliases/anyasyncfunction.md)

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

[`AsyncThrottlerOptions`](../../interfaces/asyncthrottleroptions.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

`Function`

Attempts to execute the throttled function. The execution behavior depends on the throttler options:

- If enough time has passed since the last execution (>= wait period):
  - With leading=true: Executes immediately
  - With leading=false: Waits for the next trailing execution

- If within the wait period:
  - With trailing=true: Schedules execution for end of wait period
  - With trailing=false: Drops the execution

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

### Example

```ts
const throttled = new AsyncThrottler(fn, { wait: 1000 });

// First call executes immediately
await throttled.maybeExecute('a', 'b');

// Call during wait period - gets throttled
await throttled.maybeExecute('c', 'd');
```

## Example

```ts
const throttled = asyncThrottle(async (value: string) => {
  const result = await saveToAPI(value);
  return result; // Return value is preserved
}, {
  wait: 1000,
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
  }
});

// This will execute at most once per second
// Returns the API response directly
const result = await throttled(inputElement.value);
```
