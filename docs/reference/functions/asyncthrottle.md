# Function: asyncThrottle()

```ts
function asyncThrottle<TFn>(fn, initialOptions): (...args) => Promise<undefined | ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [async-throttler.ts:341](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-throttler.ts#L341)

Creates an async throttled function that limits how often the function can execute.
The throttled function will execute at most once per wait period, even if called multiple times.
If called while executing, it will wait until execution completes before scheduling the next call.

Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.

Error Handling:
- If the throttled function throws and no `onError` handler is configured,
  the error will be thrown from the returned function.
- If an `onError` handler is configured, errors will be caught and passed to the handler,
  and the function will return undefined.
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance.

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* [`AnyAsyncFunction`](../type-aliases/anyasyncfunction.md)

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

[`AsyncThrottlerOptions`](../interfaces/asyncthrottleroptions.md)\<`TFn`\>

## Returns

`Function`

Attempts to execute the throttled function.
If a call is already in progress, it may be blocked or queued depending on the `wait` option.

Error Handling:
- If the throttled function throws and no `onError` handler is configured,
  the error will be thrown from this method.
- If an `onError` handler is configured, errors will be caught and passed to the handler,
  and this method will return undefined.
- The error state can be checked using `getErrorCount()` and `getIsExecuting()`.

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

A promise that resolves with the function's return value, or undefined if an error occurred and was handled by onError

### Throws

The error from the throttled function if no onError handler is configured

## Example

```ts
const throttled = asyncThrottle(async (value: string) => {
  const result = await saveToAPI(value);
  return result; // Return value is preserved
}, {
  wait: 1000,
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
  }
});

// This will execute at most once per second
// Returns the API response directly
const result = await throttled(inputElement.value);
```
