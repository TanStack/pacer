# Class: AsyncRateLimiter\<TFn\>

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter.ts:205](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-rate-limiter.ts#L205)

A class that creates an async rate-limited function.

Rate limiting is a simple approach that allows a function to execute up to a limit within a time window,
then blocks all subsequent calls until the window passes. This can lead to "bursty" behavior where
all executions happen immediately, followed by a complete block.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

Unlike the non-async RateLimiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.

For smoother execution patterns, consider using:
- Throttling: Ensures consistent spacing between executions (e.g. max once per 200ms)
- Debouncing: Waits for a pause in calls before executing (e.g. after 500ms of no calls)

Rate limiting is best used for hard API limits or resource constraints. For UI updates or
smoothing out frequent events, throttling or debouncing usually provide better user experience.

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the rate limiter
- `initialState` can be a partial state object
- Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful function execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onError` callback to react to function execution errors and implement custom error handling
- Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
- Use `onReject` callback to react to executions being rejected when rate limit is exceeded
- The state includes execution times, success/error counts, and current execution status
- State can be accessed via `asyncRateLimiter.store.state` when using the class directly
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `asyncRateLimiter.state`

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and rate limiter instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance
- Rate limit rejections (when limit is exceeded) are handled separately from execution errors via the `onReject` handler

## Example

```ts
const rateLimiter = new AsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => await api.getData(id),
  {
    limit: 5,
    window: 1000,
    windowType: 'sliding',
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('API call failed:', error);
    },
    onReject: (limiter) => {
      console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${limiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
    }
  }
);

// Will execute immediately until limit reached, then block
// Returns the API response directly
const data = await rateLimiter.maybeExecute('123');
```

## Methods

### getMsUntilNextWindow()

```ts
getMsUntilNextWindow(): number
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter.ts:433](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-rate-limiter.ts#L433)

Returns the number of milliseconds until the next execution will be possible
For fixed windows, this is the time until the current window resets
For sliding windows, this is the time until the oldest execution expires

#### Returns

`number`

***

### getRemainingInWindow()

```ts
getRemainingInWindow(): number
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter.ts:423](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-rate-limiter.ts#L423)

Returns the number of remaining executions allowed in the current window

#### Returns

`number`

***

### maybeExecute()

```ts
maybeExecute(...args): Promise<undefined | ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter.ts:302](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-rate-limiter.ts#L302)

Attempts to execute the rate-limited function if within the configured limits.
Will reject execution if the number of calls in the current window exceeds the limit.

Error Handling:
- If the rate-limited function throws and no `onError` handler is configured,
  the error will be thrown from this method.
- If an `onError` handler is configured, errors will be caught and passed to the handler,
  and this method will return undefined.
- The error state can be checked using `getErrorCount()` and `getIsExecuting()`.

#### Parameters

##### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

A promise that resolves with the function's return value, or undefined if an error occurred and was handled by onError

#### Throws

The error from the rate-limited function if no onError handler is configured

#### Example

```ts
const rateLimiter = new AsyncRateLimiter(fn, { limit: 5, window: 1000 });

// First 5 calls will return a promise that resolves with the result
const result = await rateLimiter.maybeExecute('arg1', 'arg2');

// Additional calls within the window will return undefined
const result2 = await rateLimiter.maybeExecute('arg1', 'arg2'); // undefined
```
