/**
 * A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncThrottler` instance to limit how often an async function can execute.
 *
 * This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
 * you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).
 *
 * Async throttling ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time window,
 * regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting expensive API calls,
 * database operations, or other async tasks.
 *
 * Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
 * making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
 * instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
 * in two ways:
 *
 * **1. Using `throttler.Subscribe` HOC (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**
 *
 * Use the `Subscribe` HOC to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
 * needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
 * in child components.
 *
 * **2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**
 *
 * The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render
 * at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant
 * state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` HOC. This prevents unnecessary
 * re-renders and gives you full control over when your component updates.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `errorCount`: Number of function executions that have resulted in errors
 * - `isExecuting`: Whether the throttled function is currently executing asynchronously
 * - `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
 * - `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
 * - `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last function execution in milliseconds
 * - `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful function execution
 * - `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp when the next execution can occur in milliseconds
 * - `settleCount`: Number of function executions that have completed (success or error)
 * - `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending' | 'executing' | 'settled')
 * - `successCount`: Number of function executions that have completed successfully
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data; // Return value is preserved
 *   },
 *   { wait: 1000 }
 * );
 *
 * // Subscribe to state changes deep in component tree using Subscribe HOC
 * <asyncThrottler.Subscribe selector={(state) => ({ isExecuting: state.isExecuting, isPending: state.isPending })}>
 *   {({ isExecuting, isPending }) => (
 *     <div>{isExecuting || isPending ? 'Loading...' : 'Ready'}</div>
 *   )}
 * </asyncThrottler.Subscribe>
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution state changes at hook level (optimized for loading indicators)
 * const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     isExecuting: state.isExecuting,
 *     isPending: state.isPending,
 *     status: state.status
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when results are available (optimized for data display)
 * const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     lastResult: state.lastResult,
 *     successCount: state.successCount,
 *     settleCount: state.settleCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when error state changes (optimized for error handling)
 * const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   {
 *     wait: 1000,
 *     onError: (error) => console.error('API call failed:', error)
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     errorCount: state.errorCount,
 *     status: state.status
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when timing information changes (optimized for timing displays)
 * const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     lastExecutionTime: state.lastExecutionTime,
 *     nextExecutionTime: state.nextExecutionTime
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // With state management and return value
 * const [data, setData] = useState(null);
 * const { maybeExecute, state } = useAsyncThrottler(
