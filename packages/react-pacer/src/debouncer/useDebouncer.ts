/**
 * A React hook that creates and manages a Debouncer instance.
 *
 * This is a lower-level hook that provides direct access to the Debouncer's functionality without
 * any built-in state management. This allows you to integrate it with any state management solution
 * you prefer (useState, Redux, Zustand, etc.).
 *
 * This hook provides debouncing functionality to limit how often a function can be called,
 * waiting for a specified delay before executing the latest call. This is useful for handling
 * frequent events like window resizing, scroll events, or real-time search inputs.
 *
 * The debouncer will only execute the function after the specified wait time has elapsed
 * since the last call. If the function is called again before the wait time expires, the
 * timer resets and starts waiting again.
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
 * to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
 * unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
 * full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
 * component re-render when the selected state values change.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `canLeadingExecute`: Whether the debouncer can execute on the leading edge
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `isPending`: Whether the debouncer is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
 * - `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
 * - `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending')
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const searchDebouncer = useDebouncer(
 *   (query: string) => fetchSearchResults(query),
 *   { wait: 500 }
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when isPending changes (optimized for loading states)
 * const searchDebouncer = useDebouncer(
 *   (query: string) => fetchSearchResults(query),
 *   { wait: 500 },
 *   (state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when executionCount changes (optimized for tracking execution)
 * const searchDebouncer = useDebouncer(
 *   (query: string) => fetchSearchResults(query),
 *   { wait: 500 },
 *   (state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
 * );
 *
 * // Multiple state properties - re-render when any of these change
 * const searchDebouncer = useDebouncer(
 *   (query: string) => fetchSearchResults(query),
 *   { wait: 500 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     isPending: state.isPending,
 *     executionCount: state.executionCount,
 *     status: state.status
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // In an event handler
 * const handleChange = (e) => {
 *   searchDebouncer.maybeExecute(e.target.value);
 * };
 *
 * // Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { isPending } = searchDebouncer.state;
 * ```
