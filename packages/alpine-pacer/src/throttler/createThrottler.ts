/**
 * Creates and retains the Throttler for its Alpine owner.
 *
 * Limits execution to at most one call per wait interval. Leading and trailing options control immediate and deferred execution; the trailing call uses the latest arguments.
 *
 * ## State and subscriptions
 *
 * Pass a selector to track only the state consumed by the owner. The default selection is {},
 * so utility state changes do not update the owner unless it opts in. Selection uses shallow
 * comparison. The raw store remains available for additional subscriptions.
 * Use utility.subscribe(childScope, selector) for a child subscription. It returns a getter
 * and cleans up with the child without canceling the parent utility.
 *
 * Available state fields:
 *
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
 * - `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
 * - `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last function execution in milliseconds
 * - `maybeExecuteCount`: Number of times maybeExecute has been called (for reduction calculations)
 * - `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp when the next execution can occur in milliseconds
 * - `status`: Current execution status - 'idle' when not active, 'pending' when waiting for timeout
 *
 * ## Options and ownership
 *
 * Pass an options object with property getters or a factory. Top-level properties are read
 * reactively; function-valued core options remain callbacks. Local options override provider
 * defaults. Updates retain the utility, its store, counters, and pending work.
 * Destroying the owning scope calls cancel().
 * onUnmount replaces default cleanup and receives the same adapter instance. A custom callback
 * must perform all required cleanup. Use flush() where supported to finish pending work.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createThrottler } from '@tanstack/alpine-pacer'
 *
 * const utility = createThrottler(
 *   scope, (value: string) => { console.log(value) },
 *   { wait: 500 },
 *   (state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending }),
 * )
 * utility.maybeExecute('item')
 * // Selected state: utility.state.isPending
 * ```
 *
 * @param scope - Owner of option updates, subscriptions, and cleanup.
 * @param fn - Function executed by the utility.
 * @param options - Core options or a reactive factory, plus an optional onUnmount callback.
 * @param selector - Selects state that updates the owner. Omit to leave selected state empty.
 * @returns The retained utility instance with selected state and child subscriptions.
